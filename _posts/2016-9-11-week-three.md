### What did I do this past week?
Early this past week I finished Collatz. After the setup was done, making optimizations to the main function of the project was fairly simple. After finishing the project, some of the additional material we needed seemed, like Doxygen, seemed a little bit extraneous given the scale of the project, but I can see this being important for the future. In particular I liked Travis CI, which despite the problems it produced for some of my classmates towards the end of the due date proved to be a great tool for development.

### What's in your way?
Once again, I don't think anything is on my way at the moment, but I'm sure that a couple of weeks from now this is going to change as midterm season approaches.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I want to start working on the next project as soon as possible. Now that I understand all the project requirements that are not actual coding I believe this will be more smooth and interesting.

### Tip of the week:
In my first blog entry I recommended using vim. If you have just made the switch, it is likely that you made the frustrating mistake of pressing command/ctrl+z to undo your changes and killed the vim process. This will lead to a weird message when restarting vim to continue working. In order to fix this, press 'R' when the message comes up, quit vim, and enter 'rm .<name_of_your_file>.swp'. This will delete a backup file that vim produces and was left unattended when the process was killed unexpectedly.
