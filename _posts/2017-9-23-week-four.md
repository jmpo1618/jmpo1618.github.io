### What did you do this past week?
This past week was very relaxed in terms of lecture material. On Monday, we had a guest speaker from Google who outlined the benefits of using Google Cloud Platform. Usually, the guests Professor Downing invites to his classes focus on their experiences as software engineers; however, this time the talk serve as a tutorial for our next project. Wednesday we were introduced to the database project that we have to develop in teams. And Friday we went back to the Python discussions. Outside of class my group started working on our project, defining which models and attributes will be needed and putting together the first design.

### What's in your way?
Professor Downing changed his mind and allowed us to form our own teams, so that is finally out of my way. I believe he made the right decision. Other than that, I think the technical report for the first phase of our database is a little bit of an obstacle at the moment. I understand that this is needed due to the writing flag attributed to the course, but at this stage, there is not a lot to talk about in written form. I do think that the report is going to be very valuable when the whole project is complete, though.

### What will you do next week?
Next week (and hopefully this weekend) I will meet with my group and try to finish the project as soon as possible.

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm satisfied with how things are going. Every aspect of the class seems fair until this point, but I am curious to see how helpful the specifications for later phases of the project are.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is to explore libraries that help with distributed computing. It is interesting and relevant to have experience in this field as a software engineer. I would recommend dispy, a Python library that allows you to spawn multiple nodes on a single machine and work on projects that could be distributed.
