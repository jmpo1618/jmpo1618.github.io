### What did you do this past week?
Every lecture this past week had a different theme. On Monday we went over some more SQL queries, on wednesday we focused on regular expression in Python, and on Friday we made a small demo of the current state of our IDB project to professor Downing and the TAs. I enjoyed the latter because it reassured us that we were on the right track in our project. Additionally, I also went to the Under Armour talk. It went over the classic Software Engineering tips, but I think that the most interesting part of it was their reference to Kubernetes. 

### What's in your way?
Not much is in my way at the moment.

### What will you do next week?
Next week my team and I will be finishing up our project. I was hoping to finish early but most of us have a busy week. Fortunately I think we all have a good grasp of what needs to get done and since we used the Flask API manager, most of the work is going to be focused on making the frontend work with that.

### What's my experience of the class?
This was an interesting week in class. We went over a lot of topics that are not necessarilly related to each other, but that were all helpful within the greater context of the class.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is to take a look at Typora. It's a real-time markdown editor. Its design is very clean and therefore has less distractions than other environments. Great for notes.
