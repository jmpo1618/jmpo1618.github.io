### What did I do this past week?
Once again, this week was relatively relaxed. My partner and I finished the Darwin project quickly after the basic setup and planning that we made the week before. Unit testing took most of my time, since we had to write approximately 650 lines of tests, which I understand is necessary but is not fun. In class we started talking about move semantics in C++ that allow very inexpensive r-value passing. We had a quiz that was challenging for those of us who had not seen these constructs before, but by the second quiz we took about it, I think it was completely clear to me.

### What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way at the moment. The next project is not due in almost two weeks and the test is not close, so this time serves as a nice break before the end of the semester. I would like to have an idea of how the test is going to be like though, in order to start studying soon.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I hope to finish the next project early. Apparently, it will be focused on inheritance, making it the most object-oriented project so far.

### Tip of the week:
For those of you interested in graphics but discouraged by the amount of work it involves, you should check [this site](http://codepen.io/dissimulate/details/eZxEBO/) out. It's just over 200 lines of Javascript and it provides a fairly accurate simulation of tearable cloth.
