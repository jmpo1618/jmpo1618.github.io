### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I finished writing unit tests for Allocator early. This meant that my project was done, but my submission was delayed by the fact that Travis CI was not connected to our private GitHub Classroom repo. This was caused by the lack of admin rights in that repo, which we had to work around (explained in the previous blog entry). We ended up submitting a PDF of our Raw Log and the link the forked private repo Travis integration. Hopefully, this will not result in an issue, since the situation was out of our hands. In class, we started implementing a container, specifically a vector, to apply our recently acquired knowledge on C++ canonical functions.

### What's in your way?
Currently nothing is in my way in relation to this class.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I plan to start and hopefully finish early the new project Darwin, which was posted last night. Unfortunately I'm going to have to wait until Tuesday to start because of test, but I already have a partner so at least that should proceed smoothly.

### Tip of the week:
My tip for this week is to use Rapid API. I learned about them yesterday at HackTX, they are a website that lists a lot of useful APIs and provides some good resources on them. Even if you don't actually need them at the moment, only looking at it can probably spark some ideas for personal projects.
