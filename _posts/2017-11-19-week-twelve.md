### What did you do this past week?
This week was one of the most calm weeks in the semester for SWE. Obviously, this is just temporary since the last project and the second test are close, but it was a nice break. During regular lectures we continued talking about refactoring, and on Wednesday we had guest lecturers to speak about ethics in CS. I really enjoyed the latter since I have always had an interest in those issues, regardless of the field.

### What's in your way?
Fortunately, not much is in my way at the moment.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I'll try to finish my portion of the last project, which basically only encompasses cleanup. I think my team was able to produce pretty complete site in the last phase, so I do not expect having to implement anything major.

### What's my experience of the class?
I enjoyed Professor Downing's decision to let us have a laid back week. It seems like he is one of the few instructors that are actually aware of the fact that students have other classes besides theirs. 

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is to listen or read to some of the work done by Scott Aaronson, professor of CS and director of UT's Quantum Information Center. His research is very interesting and refreshing since it is not as overplayed as other buzzword topics. Even if you're not into theoretical computer science, I believe that knowing the basics of this area are very valuable and even required when thinking about some problems in software engineering.
