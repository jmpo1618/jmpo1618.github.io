### What did you do this past week?
This past week in class was relatively laid back. We basically went over three join functions, how they interact with a database, and how they would be implemented in Python. I also worked on the backend for my groupd's IDB project. Specifically, I created the models for the database and wrote a JSON parser to populate it. Additionally, this past Wednesday I attended the Goldman Sachs talk. 

### What's in your way?
Not currently but earlier this week Google Cloud was in my way. For some reason, it was not able to authorize my machine's IP for me to test my work on a Postgres instance. It was frustrating to see it work on the first try the next day, indicating that I was doing nothing wrong and the Google Cloud was just not working at the time. The hours I spent trying to "fix it" make me wish we could have chosen our hosting platform.

### What will you do next week?
Hopefully wrap up this phase of IDB early in the week. The backend is almost ready to be connected to the rest of the site, so I expect the full-stack structure to be functional very soon.

### What's my experience of the class?
Although it is kind of bothersome to work on this project with little guidance, it is very satisfying to see it work, so that's good. Furthermore, the fact that lectures are relaxed, as I mentioned earlier, makes up for any issues during the project. 

### Tip of the week:
My tip of the week for those using a Postgres database is to download Postico. It's a GUI that will definitely make things easier when testing the creation of your tables.
