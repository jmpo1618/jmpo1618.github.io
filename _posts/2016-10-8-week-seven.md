### What did I do this past week?
This past week was entirely devoted to studying for the first OOP test. Since C++ has a lot of specific details that are easy to miss (especially after using mainly Python for a while), I spend most of my time going over those. Some examples of these details are deciding when to make arguments, return types, and methods constant, how to use templated classes, overloading operators, and other similar and subtle concepts. Overall I think that the test was fair. We were not asked about anything that we did not cover in class, the difficulty was right for the amount of time we were given, and there were no questions involving weird C++ tricks that are possible but unlikely to show up in practice. In terms of the format, I must say that I enjoyed typing on Canvas instead of writing code by hand even though I was hesitant at first. It is not perfect, but it is definitely the better choice for this test particularly.

### What's in your way?
Fortunately nothing is in my way right now, no test in a while and the next project is due in a little less than two weeks, so there is enough time for that.

### What will you do next week?
I plan to begin working on the project as soon as I possible since I will be out of town for HackRice over the weekend. I will definitely try to finish by then.

### Tip of the week:
My tip for this week is to try a web scraping library. I personally use BeautifulSoup of Python. This sounds broad, but if you are able to do it once, you are going to find a lot of cases where this ability is useful and will save a lot of time.
