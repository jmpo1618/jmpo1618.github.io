title: Week Eight

### What did I do this past week?
The main thing I did this past week was start working on the new project, Allocator. I had the impression that it was going to be more challenging than the last two projects but I think that the explanations given in class made it pretty straightforward. There are still some considerable problems with GitHub classroom though. Currently, my partner and I have a repository within the organization (this is the second one we created because the first one was not created through the assignment link), which we forked to a private repo in order to be able to connect it to Travis CI. Now that we know that we are going to face these issues, we were able to continue working despite the setbacks, but it would be nice if a cleaner way to approach this was required. Additionally, in class we went over the use of `new`, since it is related to the project we are working on right now.

### What's in your way?
I don't think anything is in my way right now, other than the GitHub classroom issue. My project is almost finished and the material from the lectures is clear.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will finish writing tests for the project. (Or hopefully tomorrow.)

### Tip of the week:
My tip for this week is to take more advantage of the GitHub education package. Up until recently, the only reason I had it was the ability to use private repositories (and Travis CI for the class), but they have a lot of useful things. These services are definitely enough to handle any personal project that you work on in college.
