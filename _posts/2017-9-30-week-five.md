### What did you do this past week?
This past week was devoted to finishing phase 1 of the IDB project. My team worked pretty diligently and I am really happy with the result and knowing that advocating for no random groups through these groups was fruitful. Other than that, we continued with type discussions in class and started getting into the most fun constructs of Python like generators and functions that allow cool one-liners.

### What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way at the moment, luckily. Since the test is approaching though, I would like to get more insight on the specific format from it. I heard that it has changed since the time I took OOP, so it would be nice to start studying with a little bit more of information on that.

### What will you do next week?
Depending on the information about the test I hope I can start going over the required material as soon as possible next week.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience is pretty possitive after this week. The project promises to be fun in phases to come. The lack of guidance for them is slightly concerning, but I think it is part of the experience. It is clear that similar projects of higher magnitude in industry will require us to learn new things on our own, so I understand why Professor Downing would organize the project in this manner.

### Tip of the week:
For those who haven't heard of it, I would recommend [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). This framework will let you manage your shell configuration and allow you to improve your experience with it.
