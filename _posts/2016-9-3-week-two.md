### What did I do this past week?
This past week I worked on Collatz, the first OOP project. Perhaps the main source of effort associated with the project was the initial setup. As I mentioned in my previous post, the fact that the project specification was not  detailed led to some confusion, but fortunately did not produce major setbacks. Another aspect that was more time consuming than the actual problem solving area of the project was test generation; complying with the input specifications provided by UVa proved to be less trivial than expected.

### What's in your way?
Now that the project is finished and given that the next lecture is this Wednesday due to Labor Day, I believe nothing is on my way.

### What will you do next week?
Considering the readings scheduled for next week I assume it will focus on two things: preparing us to pair program in the following projects and the principles of Object-Oriented design (specifically classes). I'm really looking forward to this because the last week and half have aimed merely at basics and tools we're going to employ, but now it seems like we are going to touch on the fundamental course objective.

### Tip of the week:
I am assuming almost everyone is familiar with Slack, but I would highly recommend creating a less formal channel with your CS friends. This provides a much more friendly environment to share code and other CS related elements than other platforms like Facebook Messenger or just regular texting.
