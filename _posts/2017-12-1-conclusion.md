Since this blog is intended to be read by prospective class takers, I want to start by saying that I recommend the class. Most of what is taught in the class is valuable, the team projects are relvant to industry work and are fun, and the effort required to succeed in the class is fair. Professor Downing is flexible regarding multiple requirements of the class; in fact, given the feedback we have given him, he will probably have an improved version of the class in future semesters. However, some seemingly arbitrary elements remain unchanged, even when several people are hvaing troube with it. A clear instance of this was Google Cloud Platform. These decisions are frustrating, but ultimately don't affect your grade, at least in my experience.
