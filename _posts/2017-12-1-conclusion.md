Since this blog is intended to be read by prospective class takers, I want to start by saying that I recommend the class. Most of what is taught in the class is valuable, the team projects are relvant to industry work and are fun, and the effort required to succeed in the class is fair.   

Professor Downing is flexible regarding multiple requirements of the class; in fact, given the feedback we have given him, he will probably have an improved version of the class in future semesters. However, some seemingly arbitrary elements remain unchanged, even when several people are hvaing troube with it. A clear instance of this was Google Cloud Platform. These decisions are frustrating, but ultimately don't affect your grade, at least in my experience.   

Finally, and probably not inherent to the nature of the class, I think that the TAs you get are influential to your experience in the class. Personally, I think that the TAs were helpful during development of the project, but their grading decisions were less than optimal. I mentioned this in a previous post, but they released their criteria after the project was due and it did not match the rubric on the project site exactly; the graders' criteria disregarded some aspects implied in the original rubric and focused on others that were not emphasized. Also, some of their considerations were entirely subjective and did not take into account the purposes in our decisions. Furthermore, they were very inflexible, even when we attempted to present evidence of our work. Hopefully this is not the case in following semesters, but it is something work considering before project submissions.
