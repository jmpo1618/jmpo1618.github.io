### What are your expectations of the class?
Having taken OOP with professor Downing before, my expectations for SWE are based on my experiences within the former. I am already familiarized with the utilization of tools and resources valuable for software engineering that are part of the class. However, the recent mention of random groups for the main projects of the class concerns me. I understand that, when facing industry work, we will not be able to choose the people in our team (at least initially), but I don't think this is an ideal schema to implement in class. Semesters are short, and the conflicts that could possibly arise among people who were forced to work together might be extensively distracting. Established teams in the industry either have time to solve interpersonal issues or methods to avoid them. Starting a fast-paced project that involves content decisions with a group of people who might fundamentally disagree with each other is definitely going to be challenging and could diminish the learning potential of the project.

### What did you do this past week?
I attended the first lectures of the class, which were entertaining even though they went over the basics. Additionally, I did the readings for next week, which were quite lengthy given the eight chapters assigned. Fortunately it's a casual read that can be done fairly quickly.

### What's in your way?
Besides the concern about the groups, nothing is in my way at the moment.

### What will you do next week?
I will start the Collatz project as soon as possible to get ahead on the rest of the material.

### What's my experience of the class?
Overall, positive. My experience with professor Downing in CS 371p made taking this class a really easy decision. I'm satisfied with the lectures and know that, even though I already use mainly Python, I will learn much more about the language.

### Tip of the week:
I've become very fond of engineering blogs and, consequently, I will suggest various of these in the following weeks. If you are a Reddit user or are interested in how they build their products and handle their challenges, I would suggest reading the technology section of [upvoted](https://upvoted.com).
