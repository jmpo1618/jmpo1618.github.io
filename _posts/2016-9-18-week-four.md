### What did I do this past week?
This past week in class we first went over the concept of pointers in class again. I feel like a have always had a fairly good grasp of the concept given my experience with C, but the fact that the quizzes are so short and contain complex pointer logic made it hard for me to get the questions right. Admittedly, I do agree that this way I will probably not make any mistake when writing actual code with pointers. We also had a guest speaker from Bloomberg; I believe this is a good initiative, but Bloomberg is so particular in terms of the tools they use that it is hard to relate to a more general feel of industry. Me and my partner also started working on the new project, Netflix.

### What's in your way?
This is probably not in my way anymore, but Travis CI combined with GitHub classroom stopped working for part of the week, making progress for the new project slow. I previously said that I liked Travis CI but its problems made me realize that I actually only like the concept of continuous integration; the actual tool we are using is not really reliable.

### What will you do next week?
Early next week (or hopefully tonight) I plan to finish Netflix.

### Tip of the week:
I would recommended that you learn how to use a scripting language if you do not know one yet. This can make your life as a CS student much more easy. For instance, now I cannot imagine using something like Java to perform simple tasks (e.g. generate cache files for this project), when I can use 5 lines of Python achieve the same results.
