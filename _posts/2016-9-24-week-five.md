### What did I do this past week?
This past week, we concluded working on Netflix. I mentioned in my previous post that my partner and I were planning on finishing early, and we did, but submission was a unexpectedly obstructed by Travis CI and its integrations with GitHub Classroom. Queues of build requests were formed as so many people worked on the project at the same time, thrashing the restriction of one build at a time. I have personally really enjoyed learning about continuous integration, but this difficulty completely defeated its purpose of generating fast builds. I believe that the format we used while working on Collatz was more fitting.
Additionally, in class we went mainly over forms of iterators for C++. I find them really interesting and useful, particularly in comparison to Java's, but still not as clean and simple as Python's constructs.

### What's in your way?
Studying for the upcoming test (a little less than two weeks from now) is in my way. I don't have a clear idea of what specifically to study and that is a bit disturbing, but hopefully this will be made more clear soon.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I plan to start for the test as soon as possible, taking advantage of the fact that our next project is not due in the near future.

### Tip of the week:
My tip for this week is related to 'git stash'. I used to only use this command in order to revert my changes, but it turns out that it actually creates a stack of versions that you stash. Therefore, if you want to bring stashed changes back for some reason, you can always enter 'git stash pop' (maybe including an index) to do so.
