### What did you do this past week?
This past week was relatively relaxed, since I finished Collatz the week before. I did take my time to submit though; with all of the details required for this project, it is imperative to wait and see if people come up with problems that you might have had and hadn't noticed. Other than that, class is starting to get insightful. ~~For instance, recently Professor Downing explained that Python deques are middle-loaded arrays, while I used to think they were linked lists.~~ (This seems to not be the case, given that the Python 3 documentation attributes O(n) time complexity to random access on `deque`s).

### What's in your way?
Nothing tangible is on my way. Once again, the only thing that worries me is the possibility of having random groups for the remainder of the class. Especially now that I can see onsite interviews reducing my availability, scheduling time to work on projects with strangers is daunting.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I will start working on the project as soon as it is posted. I am curious to see what that is going to look like.

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience this semester is starting to deviate from my experience with OOP, which is nice. Being able to learn a few more things about Python, my favorite language, makes the class entertaining.

### Tip of the week:
My tip of this week is to read research papers by companies that develop new technologies. These are very thorough and give you an insight on how big companies deal with problems related to their scalability and other needs.
