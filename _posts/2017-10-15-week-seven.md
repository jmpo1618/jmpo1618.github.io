### What did you do this past week?
This past week in class we went over Python packing and unpacking operators which demonstrate the language's flexibility. On Wednesday, we also took a Hackerrank Pre-test to be familiarized with the actual test's format. This was very convenient to avoid surprises the next day. The real test went by smoothly. Professor Downing did a pretty good job balancing the types of questions that we got. For instance, questions from the readings did not require profound memorization of details and were a small portion of the multiple choice questions.

### What's in your way?
Luckily nothing is in my way now that the exam is over and the next project due date is over a week from now.

### What will you do next week?
Next wekk I'll hopefully start and finish phase 2 of the IDB project with my team. Again, the specification seems to be pretty open, so I assume that a lot of the work is going to be discussing how to approach the implementation.

### What's my experience of the class?
The test was a good experience overall. Its contents were fair and connected to our work in class.

### Tip of the week:
For those who are just starting to use Python to solve programming problems, I would recommend looking into the `collections`, and more specifically `defaultdict`. This data structure provides a default value for keys that haven't been added to the dictionary yet, saving the classic `if key not in dictionary` check and making the code cleaner.
