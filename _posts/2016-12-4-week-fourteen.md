### Lectures
As many of my classmates have stated through their blogs, Professor Downing is one of the most interesting lecturers at UT. He is definitely knowledgable on what he is teaching and makes his material entertaining. Some people consider the way he calls on people randomly controversial but I think it is a very normal technique to make sure that the information is retained by the students. Even if attendance was not required, going to lecture is definitely worth it.

### Projects
The projects were not the most challenging tasks I had in college, but they were more the worthwhile. As I explained throughout the semester, the tools that we were obligated to use in order to receive full credit are very important in terms of working in industry. I am completely certain that without the projects, I would never have used concepts like continuous integration and issue tracking in an academic environment and in preparation for my career. Furthermore, the projects are definitely fair in terms of the material they cover in parallel to the lectures and graded appropriately. It is true that some of the tools were not completely figured out by the course staff, but this is only an indication of the class improving over time.

### Exams
In my opinion, both exams for the class were perfectly fair. They were not extremely easy, meaning that they required a good amount of studying; but they did not require excessive efforts. Mostly rewriting and understanding thoroughly the examples shown in class was enough to do well on both. Regarding the format, even though some people complain about having to write code in a Canvas text editor, I personally liked it. Writing some of these problems on paper would have been much more annoying overall; there is some improvement to be made, but I liked the concept.

### Final tip:
For those reading who are not in the class: take it. You probably won't get as much OOP skills as you imagined but you will definitely be very comfortable with C++, which is a great skill to have; you will be familiar with tools that are likely to show up if you work in industry; and you will not struggle against unfair grading or boring lectures.
