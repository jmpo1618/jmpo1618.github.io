### What did I do this past week?
This past week was relatively relaxed in comparison to the previous ones. Since the exam is close, we did not have an assigned project and did not have to spend time programming. In class, we continued to go over iterators and the implementation of AllOf, another function that uses them. Then we continued to the implementation of a class called RangeIterator, for which we implemented overridden operators such as == and ++ (pre- and post-increments). We also talked about types of constructors and had a quiz on that. The average for my section was a just less that 30%, but Dr. Downing thought it was too difficult and gave everyone full credit for the code reading questions.

### What's in your way?
Although I now thought of a general strategy to study for the test, doing that is still in my way. We have gone over a lot of material that sometimes seems to be very specific and I don't know which of those elements to include when studying.

### What will you do next week?
Continue to study for the test this Thursday and obviously take it. Luckily that's all we have to do for the class and that gives me enough time.

### Tip of the week:
In case you are working on the UTCS lab machines and for some unknown reason the computer you are working on freezes, don't submit a Shop Req immediately. Move to another machine, SSH to the one that froze and run 'killall -u your_username'. This will log you out and let you continue using the machine.
