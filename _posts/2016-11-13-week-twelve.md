### What did I do this past week?
This past week I worked on the Life project. This time, even though we still had the restriction of no getters and setters, the process was much more smooth. Getting an appropriate design and the main functionality of the classes working took much less time than expected. Of course, writing test cases still takes a lot of time, currently we have about 700 lines of tests, which is almost double the amount of actual working code for the project. In class, we continued going over inheritance and the subtleties involved within it. Polymorphism, constructor invocations, and the scope of variables are some of the topics that we touched on.

### What's in your way?
Submitting the project is on my way right now. Even though it is basically done, the fact that I am out of town at the moment makes the submission process a bit convoluted. Given the amount of logistic actions needed to submit my partner and I are going to have to figure something out in order to submit in an orderly fashion.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I will submit the project as soon as possible and hopefully do well on the upcoming quizzes since I am missing tomorrow's because of an interview.

### Tip of the week:
Some of you might already be quite familiar with machine learning, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) is a very good introductory series on it by Google Developers. If you are planning on getting started on this topic or need some extra background I recommend that you check these out.
